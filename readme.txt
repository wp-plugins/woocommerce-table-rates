Table Rates for WooCommerce allows you to setup a number of different price points for your store.

== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to create two tables of shipping rates ( one for domestic orders and one for international ).  These rates are based on the total order price in your cart.  You can specify which countries are local and which countries you want to be able to use this shipping method.
